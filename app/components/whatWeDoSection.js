          {/* COVID & Nightlife Culture Change */}
          <p className="mb-4">
            In the wake of 2020’s COVID outbreak and the subsequent lockdowns, nightlife culture 
            was changed forever. Our extended stays at home watching the ever-evolving media frenzy 
            made us all question what felt safe and meaningful in event settings and challenged the 
            precarious ways we had partied since the dawn of the DJ. Myriads of questions arose via 
            internet forums and social media, with answers coming solely from those still in the 
            thick of it – <span className="italic">Where can I party?</span> Will the event require COVID 
            tests or masks? Will there be Narcan? Is the venue queer-friendly, or more specifically 
            trans-friendly? Is the venue allowing Zionists to perform? Are the DJs being paid fairly? 
            Is there free water, or will I risk passing out on the bathroom floor…?
          </p>
  
          {/* What We Do Introduction */}
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Introducing: <span className="italic">Better Nightlife.</span></h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We aim to create a free, simple, and structured way to check the policies of your 
            favorite venues, collectives, and organizers and offer suggestions for others focusing 
            on what you care about. Need Narcan, earplugs, and First-Aid on-site to feel comfortable 
            partying? Done, here’s the list of venues with comprehensive harm prevention. Want to 
            guarantee your favorite collective is paying its artists fair rates, and doesn’t book 
            Zionists and Nazis? Easy, we’ve already checked on that for you, and here are some more 
            groups with a moral backbone to check out. Need accessibility for a wheelchair or other 
            physical disability? Absolutely, here are all the venues in your area with accessible 
            entryways and spaces. We do this through our website, with aggregated data collected and 
            reported from like-minded fans like you, as well as check-ins from our representatives 
            (a fancy way of saying we like to party ourselves!).
          </p>
  
          {/* Policy Guidelines */}
          <p className="mb-4">
            All collectives, venues, and organizers we list on our site must follow a basic set of 
            guidelines, created with insight from the party makers themselves and well-intentioned 
            superfans (think of Waze or Transit – users report data independently, and all we do is 
            sort it in an easy-to-understand format.) But it’s important to note with all of these 
            rules, we never want to exist as a strict policing body, so we offer numerous ways to 
            stay in our network. A gentle and clearly defined strike system allows any venue, 
            collective, or organizer to contact us to guarantee their policies if a discrepancy is 
            reported and work with us to improve. And we understand – shit happens, and sometimes 
            parties can’t hold up to these guidelines, and that’s okay. While we remove groups that 
            don’t follow our policies from our page, they are always welcome to reach out and 
            re-apply at any time, especially if fans are letting us know things are different. 
            Unlike big aggregated event sites like Resident Advisor, we encourage direct fan 
            feedback and love to hear what’s happening at the community level.
          </p>
